# Secure ERP

## Story

You are working at an enterprise solution company.
A new client approaches you for
an [ERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning)
software they need for the administration of
their daily operations. Naturally, you have multiple
complex solutions for this job.

The problem is that the client is _extremely_ suspicious
about cloud technologies and the web in general.
They say that what is on the net, or just on a computer
that is connected to the Internet, is already compromised,
and at least four countries' secret services come and go
there regularly.

So they want to see a solution that is _super secure_:
a short and clean codebase that works on local files,
strictly on offline computers. It is your team's job
to create such an application from scratch.

They require a highly modularized structure where
the code for different content areas are separated,
and every user and file I/O operations go through
one and only one channel. You decide to create
a variant of the MVC (model-view-controller)
architecture for terminal and local data files.

As the client wouldn't provide any real data, only the
general structure, you had to create some dummy data
for the development.
